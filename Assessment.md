# GitHub Repo Viewer Test

For this test we would like you to create a React app that fetches data about our github repos from https://api.github.com/orgs/godaddy/repos and
displays a list of our repos, clicking on one takes you to a page where you can see more details such as:
   - title
   - description
   - link to the repo page
   - language(s) in the repo
   - forks, open issues, watchers
 
You are welcome to use whatever libraries you'd like, but no need to over engineer this, we are just looking to see your thought process on something small. Please include some tests and we would love to see your creativity.

Finally, please include a README including the basics of how to install and run your project, and any further information you may want to share with us about it, such as a brief explanation of why you've chosen certain libraries to base your solution on, or anything you may have omitted due to time constraints.
